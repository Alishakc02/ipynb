#Correlation and p_value
r, p_value=pearsonr(mpg, weight1)
print(f"Pearson correlation coefficient (r):{r:.2f}")
print(f"P-value:{p_value: .2f}")

#Interpretation
#Value of r is -0.66 means it has moderate negative correlation with each other
#Value of p is 0.23>0.05, it means we accept null hypothesis.
#It will lead to the conclusion that there is relationship betwen mpg and weight1
